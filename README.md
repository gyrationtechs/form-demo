# Building React Forms With Material UI
In this projet, we are creating a form to handle user registration. It also includes a form for login.

## Usage
Clone or download the repository to your machine, Then run the command below to install dependencies.
`npm install` or `yarn add`

## Start Dev Server
After installing the projet's dependencies, run the command below to start the dev server.
`npm start` or `yarn start`

The project does not store any data on the database. We are simply creating a state to store user inputs. You'd need to connect it with a database such as Express or Firebase if you want to store the data from the form.
